# Final-Project-LHL
Heart Disease Prediction Project

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease. Using the "Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease" dataset from Kaggle, the model will analyze various personal health indicators and demographic data to identify patterns associated with heart disease risk.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes a range of variables that can be broadly categorized into demographic data, health behaviors, and health status indicators. Key columns in the dataset are:

Demographic Information: Age, Sex, Race, etc.
Health Behaviors: Smoking, Alcohol Intake, Physical Activity, Sleep patterns.
Health Status: BMI, Mental Health, Physical Health, Stroke, Diabetic Status, etc.
Heart Disease Status: Indicates whether the individual has heart disease or not (Target Variable).
Each row in the dataset represents an individual's health profile, with the columns providing detailed information about their health and lifestyle.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine if a person has heart disease or not. This involves:

Performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the correlations and patterns within the data.
Preprocessing the data for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical and numerical variables, and normalizing the data.
Building and tuning a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using data pipelines.
Evaluating the model's performance using GridSearchCV and interpreting the results.
